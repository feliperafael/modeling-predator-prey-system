# predator-prey-system

Suppose that the primary food source of the painted owls is a single prey: rats. An ecologist wants to predict the population levels of owls and spotted mice in a given region. Let R_n be the population of rats after n months and C_n the population of predatory owls. The ecologist suggested the model

The ecologist wants to know if the two species can coexist in the habitat and if the result is sensitive to the initial populations. Find the equilibrium values of the dynamic system for this prey-predator model.
